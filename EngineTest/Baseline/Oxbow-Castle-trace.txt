# Welcome to Oxbow Castle
You are a messenger sent by King Peregrin the Paranoid to find out what has become of Oxbow castle and its ruler, Lord Kevin. Previous messengers have not returned, and the king has begin to suspect Lord Kevin of plotting against him.
That is one possibility, but you have also heard stranger rumors. In the taverns, people whisper that something dark and sinister has befallen the place. Of course, it may just be the ale talking. You are here to find out!
Oxbow Castle is situated in a sharp bend of the river Oxyl, such that it is surrounded on three sides by water. It is late morning, and you have just arrived at the only entrance to the castle, an open iron gate in the south wall. It is strangely silent. No one seems to be around.
At any time you can type 'help' to see a list of commands you can say.

You go North.
You pass through the open portcullis into a dim tunnel. High in the walls on either side are arrow loops through which defenders could rain down fire on an attacker, and in the ceiling above you are murder holes through which boulders could be dropped. However, no one challenges you or raises an alarm.
At the north end of the tunnel, you pass through another open gate into an inner courtyard. For a moment, the air around you seems to shimmer, but perhaps you are only dazzled by the sun after leaving the dim tunnel.

The maid exclaims, 'Oh, thank you sir! It was awful what happened here! I was in Lord Kevin's chambers doing a bit of cleaning when those winged creatures came. Lord Kevin and his men tried to fight them, but they were all killed. I think the townspeople mostly fled. I fled too. I thought to seek sanctuary in the church, and I found the church right enough, but it's here in the middle of this strange forest and we don't know the way out!'

The statue then vanishes with a flash of light. There is a sudden breeze, and a not-unpleasant smell of grass and manure wafts in from the open gate south of you.

You pass through the gate house tunnel and back into the outer courtyard. It's the real outer couryard, not the forested fairyland with the purple sky! You have broken the enchantment and reconnected the keep with the real world.

**Congratulations!** You have won the game!
