# AdventureScript

AdventureScript is a scripting language and interpreter designed for implementing text
adventure games. This repo contains the following subdirectories:

- **AdventureScript** is a shared library that implements the interpreter and game
  engine.

- **TextAdventure** is a terminal-based application implemented using the
  AdventureScript library.

- **OxbowCastle** is a WinUI3 application implemented using the AdventureScript library.

- **Games** contains games implemented in AdventureScript. This includes a Demo game,
  which is intended as a code sample for writing your own games.

- **EngineTest** implements a set of tests for the game engine.

- **Docs** contains a walkthrough of the [Demo](Docs/Demo.md) game as well as reference
  documentation for the [AdventureScript Language](Docs/AdventureScript-Language.md).

Contributions are welcome. In particular, it is hoped that this project inspires people to
create their own games. Please see <CONTRIBUTING.md> for guidance on how to contribute to
this project.
